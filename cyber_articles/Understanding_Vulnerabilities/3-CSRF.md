# 3- CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY

### A) Introduction
>Cross-Site Request Forgery, alias CSRF, is a web security vulnerability that exploits the trust a web application places in an authenticated user. Instead of attacking the system directly, CSRF attacks manipulate users themselves into unknowingly triggering actions on a website where they are already logged in.

>CSRF operates by abusing active authentication sessions. When a user is authenticated, the browser automatically includes session credentials with each request. An attacker can take advantage of this behavior by tricking the user into submitting a malicious request, causing the application to execute an unintended action on the user's behalf. These actions may include changing account settings, submitting forms or initiating transactions without the user's consent.

This type of attack is particularly dangerous because it does not require compromising user credentials. Instead, it relies on legitimate user sessions, making malicious payload and requests that appear valid to the application. As a result, CSRF represents a significant threat to web applications, especially those that lack proper request validation and protection mechanisms.

###  B) Historical context
>CSRF attacks emerged alongside the early growth of web applications that relied heavily on session-based authentication. In the early stages of the web, many applications implicitly trusted requests coming from authenticated users, without verifying whether those request were intentionally initiated by them.

>As attackers began exploiting this trust model, CSRF attacks bacame more widely recognized as a serious security issue. Early web applications were particularly vulnerable due to the lack of build-in protections and limited awareness of request-based attacks.

Over time, increased understanding of CSRF led to the development of dedicated defensive mechanisms such as anti-CSRF tokens and stricter request validation. Today, CSRF protection is considered a standard requirement in modern web application security practices.

### C) Impacts
>CSRF attacks can have serious consequences for web applications by allowing unauthorized actions to be performed using a legitimate user’s authenticated session. Because these actions appear to come from a trusted user, they are often difficult to detect without proper security controls.

>The impact of a CSRF attack depends on the functionality exposed by the application. In many cases, attackers can modify user settings, change credentials, or trigger sensitive operations without the user’s knowledge. In more critical contexts, CSRF attacks may lead to financial loss, unauthorized data changes, or compromise of business-critical processes. Beyond immediate technical damage, CSRF attacks can also affect user trust and organizational credibility. When users realize that actions were performed on their behalf without consent, the perceived reliability and security of the application can be significantly undermined.

For these reasons, CSRF attacks represent a serious threat to the integrity of web applications and must be addressed as part of a comprehensive security strategy.

### D) Mitigation Strategies
>Mitigate CSRF attacks focuses on ensuring that requests sent to a web application are intentionally initiated by the authenticated user. The most widely adopted and effective protection is the use of `anti-CSRF tokens.` These tokens are unique, unpredictable values generated by the server and included in requests that perform sensitive actions. When a request is received, the application verifies the token to confirm its legitimacy.

>Another important mitigation technique is `request validation`, which involves checking the origin and structure of incoming requests. By validating request headers and ensuring that sensitive operations require explicit user interaction, applications can reduce the risk of unauthorized actions being executed silently.

>We can also use secure cookie attributes such as `SameSite`, `Secure`and `HttpOnly`. They help control how cookies are sent with requests, limiting the ability of attackers to abuse authenticated sessions across different sites.

When combined, these strategies significantly reduce the likelihood of successful CSRF attacks. Implementing them as part of standard development practices allows organizations to strengthen web application security without relying on a single defensive mechanism.

### E) Conclusion
>CSRF is a critical web security vulnerability that exploits the trust between users and authenticated web applications. By abusing active user sessions, CSRF attacks can trigger unauthorized actions without requiring direct access to user credentials, making them defficult to detect.

>Understanding how CSRF attacks operate, their potential impact, and the importance of mitigation strategies is essential for maintaining the integrity of web applications. Techniques such as anti-CSRF tokens, request validation and secure cookie attributes provide effective protection when consistenly applied throughout the development process.

>To maintain a strong security posture, organizations should regularly review their applications for CSRF vulnerabilities and ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place. Proactive mitigation not only reduces risk but also reinforces user trust in the security of web systems.

In the last section, the focus will shift to patches and their role in addressing known vulnerabilities. This topic will explore why timely patching is essential for reducing exposure to threats and maintaining the long-term security of software systems.
