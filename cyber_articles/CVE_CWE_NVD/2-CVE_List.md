# CVE List and CVE ID Assignment Process

## Overview

The CVE List is a centralized repository of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, each identified by a unique CVE ID.

The assignment of CVE IDs follows a structured process to ensure consistency, traceability, and reliable communication across the cybersecurity community.

## CVE ID Assignment Process

The process of assigning a CVE ID generally includes the following steps:

1. A vulnerability is discovered and reported by a researcher, vendor, or security organization  
2. The vulnerability is reviewed to confirm it is unique and meets CVE eligibility criteria  
3. A CVE ID is assigned to the vulnerability  
4. The vulnerability information is published and made available to the public  

This process ensures that each vulnerability can be referenced unambiguously across tools, advisories, and security reports.

## Management of the CVE List

The CVE List is managed by **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, which operates the CVE Program and maintains the integrity and coordination of the CVE ecosystem.

MITRE ensures that CVE standards, policies, and processes are consistently applied worldwide.

## Role of CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs)

CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) are organizations authorized to assign CVE IDs for vulnerabilities within their scope.

Their role includes:

- Validating reported vulnerabilities  
- Assigning CVE IDs without central bottlenecks  
- Publishing vulnerability details in a timely manner  

CNAs may include software vendors, security companies, research institutions, and open-source projects.

## Conclusion

The CVE List relies on a distributed yet coordinated model, where MITRE oversees the program and CNAs handle vulnerability identification and numbering, enabling scalable and efficient vulnerability disclosure.
