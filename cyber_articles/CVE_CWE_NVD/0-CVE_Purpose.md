# Purpose of CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

## Overview

The purpose of CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is to provide a standardized and publicly accessible system for identifying known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

CVE assigns a unique identifier to each vulnerability, ensuring that security professionals, vendors, and organizations can reference the same issue consistently and without ambiguity.

## Role in Vulnerability Management

CVE supports effective vulnerability management by:

- Enabling accurate tracking of vulnerabilities across tools and platforms  
- Allowing correlation between vulnerabilities, patches, exploits, and severity scores (e.g., CVSS)  
- Reducing confusion caused by multiple names for the same security issue  

This standardization improves prioritization and remediation efforts.

## Role in Information Sharing

CVE enhances information sharing by:

- Providing a common reference used by security teams, vendors, and security tools  
- Facilitating clear communication during vulnerability disclosure and incident response  
- Supporting interoperability between vulnerability scanners, threat intelligence platforms, and security databases  

## Conclusion

CVE serves as a foundational component of the global cybersecurity ecosystem, enabling clear communication, efficient vulnerability management, and coordinated responses to security threats.
