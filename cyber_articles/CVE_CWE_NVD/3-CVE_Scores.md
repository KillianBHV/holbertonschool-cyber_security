# CVEs, CVSS Scores, and Cybersecurity Posture

## Overview

Organizations can use CVEs together with CVSS scores to better assess risk, prioritize remediation efforts, and strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture.

While CVEs identify *what* the vulnerability is, CVSS scores indicate *how severe* it is, enabling informed and consistent security decisions.

## Using CVEs and CVSS Scores Effectively

CVEs and CVSS scores help organizations to:

- Identify and track known vulnerabilities across assets  
- Quantify risk using standardized severity metrics  
- Prioritize remediation based on potential impact and exploitability  

CVSS scores provide a numerical and qualitative severity rating (e.g., low to critical), supporting objective risk comparison.

## Integrating CVE Information into Vulnerability Management Programs

Effective integration strategies include:

- **Asset correlation**  
  Mapping CVEs to affected systems to understand real exposure  

- **Risk-based prioritization**  
  Combining CVSS scores with business impact and asset criticality  

- **Patch and remediation workflows**  
  Linking CVEs to patch management and mitigation processes  

- **Continuous monitoring**  
  Regularly scanning systems and updating vulnerability inventories  

CVSS, maintained by **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, provides a common scoring framework that enhances consistency across tools and teams.

## Conclusion

By combining CVE identification with CVSS-based risk scoring, organizations can move from reactive patching to proactive, risk-driven vulnerability management, improving both security effectiveness and operational efficiency.
