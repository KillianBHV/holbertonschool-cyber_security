# Difference Between CWE and CVE

## What is CWE?

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) is a classification system that describes **types of software weaknesses**.

Rather than identifying individual vulnerabilities, CWE focuses on **the underlying coding or design flaws** that can lead to security issues, such as improper input validation or weak authentication mechanisms.

## What is CVE?

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a standardized list of **specific, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities** found in real-world software and systems.

Each CVE represents a concrete instance of a security flaw in a particular product or version.

## Key Differences Between CWE and CVE

- **CWE** describes *classes of weaknesses* (the root causes)  
- **CVE** identifies *individual vulnerabilities* (real occurrences)  
- CWE answers **“what kind of mistake”**  
- CVE answers **“where and in which product”**

In practice, a CVE is often linked to one or more CWEs that explain the weakness behind it.

## Why Both Are Important in Cybersecurity

Both CWE and CVE play complementary roles:

- **CVE** supports vulnerability tracking, disclosure, and remediation  
- **CWE** helps developers and security teams understand and eliminate root causes  

Together, they enable organizations to:

- Respond to existing vulnerabilities (CVE-driven)  
- Improve secure development practices and prevent future flaws (CWE-driven)  

## Conclusion

CVE focuses on *identifying and managing known vulnerabilities*, while CWE focuses on *understanding and preventing the weaknesses that cause them*. Both are essential for a comprehensive and proactive cybersecurity strategy.
