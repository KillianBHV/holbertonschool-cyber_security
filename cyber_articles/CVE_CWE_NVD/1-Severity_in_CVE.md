# Severity in CVE and Security Prioritization

## Overview

The severity of a CVE influences how organizations prioritize security measures by indicating the potential impact and urgency of a vulnerability.

Severity levels (low, medium, high, critical) support risk-based decision-making and help allocate resources to the most threatening issues first.

## Impact on Security Prioritization

Severity determines:

- The urgency of remediation  
- The type of response required (monitoring, patching, or emergency action)  
- The level of operational disruption acceptable  

Higher severity vulnerabilities receive higher priority.

## Response Strategies by Severity Level

### Low

- Minimal impact and low exploitability  
- **Response:** Monitor and remediate during routine maintenance  

### Medium

- Moderate impact under specific conditions  
- **Response:** Patch within a reasonable timeframe and increase monitoring  

### High

- Significant impact and realistic exploitation risk  
- **Response:** Prioritize patching and apply mitigations if needed  

### Critical

- Severe impact with active or likely exploitation  
- **Response:** Immediate action, emergency patching, or system isolation  

## Conclusion

CVE severity levels enable organizations to respond proportionally to risk, ensuring critical vulnerabilities are addressed first while maintaining operational stability.
